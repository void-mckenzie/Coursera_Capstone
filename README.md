The 100 most populous metropolitan cities of the world were clustered based on their FourSquare Location data. BeautifulSoup was used to scrape data, while API-calls to Foursquare were made to get the location data. Geocoder was used to get co-ordinates of the cities. Data pre-processing and wrangling was extensively performed using Pandas. Sci-kit learn was used to perform the analysis, and Folium was used to create interactive geo-spatial maps.
